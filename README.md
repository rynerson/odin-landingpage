# odin-landingpage
The goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of flexbox through the development of a landing page. I was given a photograph of what the given website should look like when it is finished. I was also given information about the different fonts, sizes, and colors used, however I was free to select my own fonts and colors if I wanted to. I divided the project into several maneagable pieces. On each piece, I started with the HTML and finished with the CSS. This process helped me not become overwhelmed. I used some photographs that I already took. To see the completed project, you can go to https://rynerson.github.io/odin-landingpage/.
